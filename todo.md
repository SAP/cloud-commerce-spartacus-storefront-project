# TODO

1. "Generic" components that are in `core` and/or `storefrontlib` - having the "Edit Configuration" button on the cart page - customers would have to specifically add a configurable product in their catalog, and only then they would see it on the page.
    - it's not just the mentioned button, there's more to it - i.e. more elements present on the cart page
    - order history page as well
    - checkout page as well
