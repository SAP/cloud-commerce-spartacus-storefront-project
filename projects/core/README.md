# Spartacus Core Library

The Spartacus Core Library provides core Spartacus features, which are a required building block for other Spartacus libraries.

To quickly add Spartacus libraries to an Angular application, you can use Spartacus schematics: `ng add @spartacus/schematics`. This will setup and install Spartacus libraries to your Angular project. Please check the [official Spartacus schematics documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_COMMERCE_COMPOSABLE_STOREFRONT/31164ec95c7c4136b1d1a4a371cad3c7/e38d45609de04412920a7fc9c13d41e3.html) for all the prerequisites and instruction on how to use Spartacus schematics.
