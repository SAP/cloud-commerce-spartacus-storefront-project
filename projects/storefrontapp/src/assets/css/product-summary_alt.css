  SPARTA v0.1
  This file is for theme configuration. These variables are used in global and component CSS files.

  You can:
    1) Set new values for Bootstrap variables - https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/_variables.scss
    2) Set new values for cxbase variables - cxbase/_variables.scss
    3) Set new values for component variables - app/__/_.scss
  You cannot:
    1) Add new variables
*/
/*!
  CXBASE VARIABLES
  This is NOT a theme.

  This file should include ONLY new variables that Bootstrap does not provide.
  For example, Bootstrap does not have a variable for semi font weight.

  Same case for directionality.

  Also be aware of items that should be configurable.
  The Sparta buttons use uppercase type but future themes may want normal case
  so a variable was created to make this available for other themes.

/*
GLOBAL VARIABLE OVERRIDES
  These can be set with anything above or any variables exposed in Bootsrap or cxbase
*/
/*
COMPONENT VARIABLE OVERRIDES
  For example, the following would override the cx-storefront background set in src/app/ui/layout/main/main.component.scss
  $cx-storefront-background-color: "info";
*/
* {
  color: red; }
