# Technical Changes in Spartacus 4.0

## Breaking Changes Introduced in 4.0

### CartListItemComponent
- Removed `FeatureConfigService` from constructor and added `UserIdService` and `MultiCartService` to constructor.
- Property `form: FormGroup` is now initialized on component creation instead of in the `createForm()` method.
-  `ngOnInit()` method has been modified to fix an issue with rendering items.
- `[class.is-changed]` template attribute on `<div>` tag now depends on method `control.get('quantity').disabled`.
