# Updating to Spartacus 2.0

## Breaking changes introduced in 2.0

**Storage sync mechanism change in multi cart**

Storage synchronization mechanism previously used to persist active cart id had some limitations that caused bugs on multi site stores (issue: [https://github.com/SAP/cloud-commerce-spartacus-storefront/issues/6215](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-commerce-spartacus-storefront/issues/6215)).
Default storage sync configuration was removed from `MultiCartStoreModule`. Instead state persistence mechanism have been added for multi cart to provide the same behavior and to support multi site stores. It is build on top of `StatePersistenceService`. This is a new and recommended way to synchronize state to browser storage. Head to docs (TODO: add link to state persistence doc when it will be published) for more information.

**Config Validation mechanism is now a separate module**

Previously config validator logic was part of `ConfigModule`. If you are not using `StorefrontFoundationModule` or any of its descendants, it's required to import `ConfigValidatorModule.forRoot()` in order to make config validators run.

**Cart state and selectors removed**

We are replacing old `cart` store feature (`CART_DATA`, `StateWithCart`, `CartsState`, `CART_FEATURE`, `CartState`) along with it's selectors (`CartSelectors`) with new cart state available in previous version under `multi-cart`. We recommend working with `ActiveCartService` and `MultiCartService` which uses under the hood new `cart` store feature. It allows us to support more carts (eg. wishlist, saved carts).

**Typed payloads in ngrx actions**

To avoid one type of bugs (missing parameters) when dispatching ngrx actions we added types to their payload. We want to be sure that we always have all required parameters. Additionally with types creating new actions is easier, as you get better editor support when specifying payload.

List of actions with changed payload type: `CartAddEntry`, `CartAddEntrySuccess`, `CartRemoveEntry`, `CartRemoveEntrySuccess`, `CartUpdateEntry`, `CartUpdateEntrySuccess`, `AddEmailToCartSuccess`, `MergeCartSuccess`, `CartAddEntryFail`, `CartRemoveEntryFail`, `CartUpdateEntryFail`, `CartRemoveVoucherFail`, `CartRemoveVoucherSuccess`, `CreateCart`, `CreateCartFail`, `CreateCartSuccess`, `LoadCart`, `LoadCartFail`, `LoadCartSuccess`, `LoadWishList`, `LoadWishListSuccess`.

Removed actions: `CreateMultiCart`, `CreateMultiCartFail`, `CreateMultiCartSuccess`, `LoadMultiCart`, `LoadMultiCartFail`, `LoadMultiCartSuccess`.

New actions: `LoadWishListFail` - for consistency in wishlist it now have dedicated fail action. It will be dispatched in wishlist effects instead of `LoadCartFail` action.

**Factories removed from storefrontlib public API**

`pwaConfigurationFactory`, `pwaFactory`, `getStructuredDataFactory` and `skipLinkFactory` were removed from storefront library public API.

**Bad Request handler**

The `BadRequestHandler` handles 400 errors. Previously it was handling *not found* errors for OCC CMS pages, as these weren't returned as 404 errors. This was done in a generic way, by handling *all other errors*. Since the 1905 release of SAP Commerce, the OCC CMS returns a 404 error in case of a not found page. Therefor, we removed this special handling in the `BadRequestHandler`. This might affect custom implementations who relied on this behaviour. In that case it is recommended to throw 404 errors from the backend you're using, or customize the `BadRequestHandler`. 

**UrlMatcherFactoryService was renamed to UrlMatcherService and its methods were renamed**

The service `UrlMatcherFactoryService` was renamed to `UrlMatcherService` and its methods were renamed as follows:
|  UrlMatcherFactoryService (removed) | UrlMatcherService (new counterpart) |
|-------|-----|
| getFalsyUrlMatcher | getFalsy |
| getMultiplePathsUrlMatcher | getFromPaths |
| getPathUrlMatcher | getFromPath |
| getOppositeUrlMatcher | getOpposite |
| getGlobUrlMatcher | getFromGlob |

**New way to opt-out from suffix routes for PDP and PLP**
Before 2.0 the suffix routes (added for backward compatibility with accelerators) `**/p/:productCode` and `**/c/:categoryCode` were implemented in Spartacus using separate Angular `Routes` objects. To opt-out from then, it was needed to dismantle `ProductDetailsPageModule` (or relatively `ProductListingPageModule`) and reassemble again without defining suffix routes.

Now the separate objects for suffix routes were dropped they suffix mechanism in now implemented in the original `product` and `category` routes, thanks to the support of configurable Angular `UrlMatcher`s that arrived in Spartacus 2.0.

So the default config of Spartacus for the route `product` contains now a property `matchers` with an array containing `PRODUCT_DETAILS_URL_MATCHER` (relevantly `category` route's config has `PRODUCT_LISTING_URL_MATCHER` in the `matchers` array by default). Those matchers match both the `paths` from the routing config as well as the suffix patterns `**/p/:productCode` and `**/c/:categoryCode`. To opt-out from suffix patterns, please set the `matchers` routes' config explicitly to `null` or to array containing your custom matcher(s).

### Deprecated since 1.2

|  API  | Replacement |  Notes  |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| CheckoutActions.ClearCheckoutDeliveryModeSuccess() | CheckoutActions.ClearCheckoutDeliveryModeSuccess(payload) | The `ClearCheckoutDeliveryModeSuccess` action requires payload. `CheckoutActions.ClearCheckoutDeliveryModeSuccess(payload: { userId: string; cartId: string })` |
| `ANONYMOUS_USERID` | `OCC_USER_ID_ANONYMOUS` | OCC constants are now available under `OCC` prefix to make it more clear that these variables are related to `OCC`.
| AddressBookComponentService.addUserAddress(userAddressService: UserAddressService) | AddressBookComponentService(userAddressService, checkoutDeliveryService) | The constructor now uses also CheckoutDeliveryService. `AddressBookComponentService(userAddressService: UserAddressService, checkoutDeliveryService: CheckoutDeliveryService)` |
| CheckoutGuard(router: Router, config: CheckoutConfig, routingConfigService: RoutingConfigService) | CheckoutGuard(router, routingConfigService, checkoutConfigService, expressCheckoutService, cartService) | The constructor now uses new dependencies. `CheckoutGuard(router: Router, routingConfigService: RoutingConfigService, checkoutConfigService: CheckoutConfigService, expressCheckoutService: ExpressCheckoutService, cartService: ActiveCartService)` |

### Deprecated since 1.3

|  API  | Replacement |  Notes  |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| PageMetaResolver.resolve() | Use individual resolvers | The caller `PageMetaService` service is improved to expect all individual resolvers instead, so that the code is easier extensible. |
| `initSiteContextRoutesHandler`, `siteContextParamsProviders` | - | the constants were not meant to be exported in public API |
| `inititializeContext`, `contextServiceProviders` | - | the constants were not meant to be exported in public API |

### Deprecated since 1.4

| API                               | Replacement | Notes                                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| config `i18n.backend.crossDomain` | -           | it's not needed anymore since using Angular HttpClient for loading i18n assets |
| `CartService` removed | Use `ActiveCartService` instead | `ActiveCartService` have exactly the same name, arguments and return type for most of the methods from `CartService`. One function was renamed - `getLoaded` changed to `isStable` to better describe function behavior. Two methods are not present in `ActiveCartService`. Method `getCartMergeComplete` was removed on purpose. Cart merging is an implementation detail of OCC and we don't consider that information useful. Instead you can rely on `isStable` method that will correctly present state of the cart. During cart merge it will emit `false` values. Rule of thumb is to only dispatch cart modifications (eg. addEntry, addEmail) when `isStable` emits `true`. Method `addVoucher` is also not available in `ActiveCartService`. Instead use `CartVoucherService.addVoucher` method. |
| `CartDataService` removed | Use methods from `ActiveCartService` and `AuthService` | Our libraries are generally moving towards reactive programming and observables. `CartDataService` used completely different patterns and it was hard to follow if data there was already updated or represented previous cart state. Replacements for `CartDataService` properties: `userId` -> replace usage with `AuthService.getOccUserId()`, `cart` -> replace usage with `ActiveCartService.getActive()`, `cartId` -> replace usage with `ActiveCartService.getActiveCartId()`, `isGuestCart` -> replace usage with `ActiveCartService.isGuestCart()`. Property `hasCart` doesn't have direct replacement. Instead you can look into `ActiveCartService.getActive()` method output to see if it emitted empty object (which means that there is no cart). |
| `ProductService` and `CurrentProductSerive` use product scopes | - | In some cases current product won't return full product model. You should use scopes to optimize backend calls related to product data. | 

### Deprecated since 1.5

|  API  | Replacement |  Notes  |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| WishlistEffects, CartEffects, CartVoucherEffects, CartEntryEffects, effects | Create your own effects in separate class and take into account default behavior from effects | We didn't plan to export effects in the first place. Cart effects in public API were a mistake. If you extended this class, you should move your effects to separate class and keep in mind that default effects will be working. |
| getReducers, reducerToken, reducerProvider, clearCartState, metaReducers, clearMultiCartState, multiCartMetaReducers, multiCartReducerToken, getMultiCartReducers, multiCartReducerProvider | Extend cart behavior in higher level (facade) or use custom actions for your specific use case | We didn't plan to export reducers and utilities for reducers in the first place. Cart reducers in public API were a mistake. Any changes to reducers should be handled in different layer (facade) or separate store module. Keep in mind that default reducer behavior will be working under the hood.|
| `CartDetailsComponent.getAllPromotionsForCart` method removed | Use `PromotionService` | `PromotionService` is now the main promotion data source. Whenever you need promotions information you should use this service. |
| `OrderDetailItemsComponent.getConsignmentProducts` method removed | Use `OrderConsignedEntriesComponent` instead | This functionality has been extracted into separate component. |   
| `CartItemComponent.potentialProductPromotions` input removed | Use `PromotionService` | `PromotionService` is now the main promotion data source. Whenever you need promotions information you should use this service. |
| `CartItemListComponent.potentialProductPromotions` input removed | Use `PromotionService` | `PromotionService` is now the main promotion data source. Whenever you need promotions information you should use this service. |
| `OrderDetailItemsComponent.potentialProductPromotions` input removed | Use `PromotionService` | `PromotionService` is now the main promotion data source. Whenever you need promotions information you should use this service. |
| `CartItemListComponent.getPotentialProductPromotionsForItem` method removed | Use `PromotionService` | `PromotionService` is now the main promotion data source. Whenever you need promotions information you should use this service. |

### Automated migrations of page meta resolvers
The implementation of page meta data resolvers has been changed with 2.0. Previously, each meta resolver implementation has been responsible to resolve all page data, by implemeting the abstract `resolve` method from the abstract `PageMetaResolver`. To allow for more flexibility and simplfiy cusomisations, the individual implementations no longer implement the resolve method. Only a specific *resolver* is required, such as the `PageTitleResolver`. The `PageMetaService` will invoke the specific resolvers when available. This is done by the registered `resolverMethods`. You can further extend the list of `resolverMethods` without changing the implementation of `PageMetaService.resolve`.

These changes have been introduced under a feature flag in version 1.3, and are standardized in 2.0. The `FeatureConfigService` was used for this feature flag, and has been dropped from all constructors with version 2.0. This change will be migrated automatically.

The individual changes for 2.0 per class are:

- `PageMetaService`  
  The `resolverMethods` access modifier changed from *public* to *protected*. The `resolve` method will invoke individual resolvers by iterating over the `resolverMethods`.
- `ContentPageMetaResolver`  
  The deprecated method `resolve` is removed with 2.0. This method is no longer supported as individual resolve methods (`resolveTitle` and `resolveBreadcrumbs`) are invoked by the `PageMetaService` directly. The individual resolvers no longer receive arguments, but use the local `cms$` observable to resolve the required data.
- `ProductPageMetaResolver`  
  The deprecated method `resolve` is removed with 2.0. This method is no longer supported as individual resolve methods (`resolveHeading`, `resolveTitle`, `resolveDescription`, `resolveBreadcrumbs`, `resolveImage` and `resolveRobots`) are invoked by the `PageMetaService` directly. The individual resolvers no longer receive arguments, but use the local `product$` observable to resolve the required data.
- `CategoryPageMetaResolver`
  The deprecated method `resolve` is removed with 2.0. This method is no longer supported as individual resolve methods (`resolveTitle` and `resolveBreadcrumbs`) are invoked by the `PageMetaService` directly. The individual resolvers (`resolveTitle`, `resolveBreadcrumbs`) no longer receive arguments, but use the local `searchPage$` observable to resolve the required data.
- `SearchPageMetaResolver`
  The deprecated method `resolve` is removed with 2.0. This method is no longer supported as the individual resolve method (`resolveTitle`) is invoked by the `PageMetaService` directly. The individual resolver (`resolveTitle`) no longer receive arguments, but use the local `query$` observable to resolve the required data.
- `CartPageMetaResolver`  
  The deprecated method `resolve` is removed with 2.0. This method is no longer supported as individual resolve methods (`resolveTitle`, `resolveRobots`) are invoked by the `PageMetaService` directly. The individual resolvers (`resolveTitle`, `resolveRobots`) no longer receive arguments, but use the local `cms$` observable to resolve the required data.
- `CheckoutPageMetaResolver`  
  The deprecated method `resolve` is removed with 2.0. This method is no longer supported as individual resolve methods (`resolveTitle`, `resolveRobots`) are invoked by the `PageMetaService` directly. The individual resolvers (`resolveTitle`, `resolveRobots`) no longer receive arguments, but use the local `cart$` observable to resolve the required data.
- `CouponSearchPageResolver` ~~`FindProductPageMetaResolver`~~  
  The ~~`FindProductPageMetaResolver`~~ was introduced with in version 1.5, and has been renamed to `CouponSearchPageResolver` in version 2.0. 
  
  The deprecated method `resolve` is removed with 2.0. This method is no longer supported as individual resolve methods (`resolveTitle`, `resolveBreadcrumbs`) are invoked by the `PageMetaService` directly. The individual resolvers (`resolveTitle`, `resolveBreadcrumbs`) no longer receive arguments, but use the local `total$` observable to resolve the required data. 

  The `score` method was refactored heavily to better cope with synchronize router state. This resulted in a change in the constructor which should be migrated automatically.
  
# Larger refactoring for 2.0

## Components

### Pagination Component
The reusable `PaginationComponent` has been completely refactored for 2.0. The pagination component had various flaws in version 1 and the implementation wasn't great either. The new version is fully configurable and easily extensible as the *build* logic is solely delegated to the new `PaginationBuilder`. 
The default configuration is more conceise and shows maximum 3 pages with a start and end link. 

The HTML and companied CSS is refactored as well. A clean DOM exists of only anchor links, nothing more. The availability and order of pagination links is driven by the configuration. The component is fully accessible and prepared for directionality as well. 

Using anchor links is the prefered action for pagination links, but action links (usign `click` events) are still supported and used in various areas in Spartacus. The product listing page however is using anchor links.

The component is fully [documented](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-commerce-spartacus-storefront-docs/blob/v2-develop/_pages/dev/components/shared-components/pagination.md).

If you have used the pagination component directly, you should refactor the implementation, as the inputs have changed.
