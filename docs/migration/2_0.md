# Migrating to Spartacus 2.0

## Breaking changes introduced in 2.0

 

### Deprecated since 1.3

---
#### PageMetaResolver.resolve() method is removed

The resolve method is no longer preferred and will be removed with release 2.0.
The caller `PageMetaService` service is improved to expect all individual resolvers
instead, so that the code is easier extensible.
