# Updating to Spartacus 2.0

## Breaking changes introduced in 2.0

**Storage sync mechanism change in multi cart**

Storage synchronization mechanism previously used to persist active cart id had some limitations that caused bugs on multi site stores (issue: [https://github.com/SAP/cloud-commerce-spartacus-storefront/issues/6215](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-commerce-spartacus-storefront/issues/6215)).
Default storage sync configuration was removed from `MultiCartStoreModule`. Instead state persistence mechanism have been added for multi cart to provide the same behavior and to support multi site stores. It is build on top of `StatePersistenceService`. This is a new and recommended way to synchronize state to browser storage. Head to docs (TODO: add link to state persistence doc when it will be published) for more information.

### Deprecated since 1.2

|  API  | Replacement |  Notes  |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| CheckoutActions.ClearCheckoutDeliveryModeSuccess() | CheckoutActions.ClearCheckoutDeliveryModeSuccess(payload) | The `ClearCheckoutDeliveryModeSuccess` action supports payload. `CheckoutActions.ClearCheckoutDeliveryModeSuccess(payload: { userId: string; cartId: string })` |
| AddressBookComponentService.addUserAddress(userAddressService: UserAddressService) | AddressBookComponentService(userAddressService, checkoutDeliveryService) | The constructor now uses also CheckoutDeliveryService. `AddressBookComponentService(userAddressService: UserAddressService, checkoutDeliveryService: CheckoutDeliveryService)` |
| CheckoutGuard(router: Router, config: CheckoutConfig, routingConfigService: RoutingConfigService) | CheckoutGuard(router, routingConfigService, checkoutConfigService, expressCheckoutService, cartService) | The constructor now uses new dependencies. `CheckoutGuard(router: Router, routingConfigService: RoutingConfigService, checkoutConfigService: CheckoutConfigService, expressCheckoutService: ExpressCheckoutService, cartService: ActiveCartService)` |

### Deprecated since 1.3

|  API  | Replacement |  Notes  |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| PageMetaResolver.resolve() | Use individual resolvers | The caller `PageMetaService` service is improved to expect all individual resolvers instead, so that the code is easier extensible. |

### Deprecated since 1.4
