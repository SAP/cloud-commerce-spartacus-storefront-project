# Technical Changes in Spartacus 3.0

## Breaking Changes

### Default Router options changed
The angular router can be initialized with so-called `ExtraOptions` in the `forRoot` method fo the `RouterModule`. The `forRoot` method can only be called once in an angular application, which makes the default options rather opinionated. 

To make these options more optional, we moved the initialization of the `RouterModule` to the `B2cStorefrontModule` and (new) `B2BStorefrontModule` recipes. These modules are more opinionated by nature and often replaced by a customer storefront module. 

Additionally, the `ExtraOptions` have changed in 3.0.:
| Option | < 3.0 | > 3.0 | 
| --- | --- |  --- | 
| `anchorScrolling` | `'enabled'` | `'enabled'` 
| `scrollPositionRestoration` | `'enabled'` | n/a
| `relativeLinkResolution` | n/a | `'corrected'`

The RouterModule is initialize in 3.0 with the following configuration:
```typescript
RouterModule.forRoot([], {
    anchorScrolling: 'enabled',
    relativeLinkResolution: 'corrected'
})
```

There's no automation planned for this change. If you have creating a custom `StorefrontModule`, you might need to add the `RouterModule.forRoot` in your application if you  haven't done this already.
