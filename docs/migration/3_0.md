# Technical Changes in Spartacus 3.0

## Breaking Changes

### Default Router options changed
The Angular router can be initialized with so-called `ExtraOptions` in the `forRoot` method fo the `RouterModule`. See https://angular.io/api/router/ExtraOptions for more information on those options. 

The default `ExtraOptions` have changed with 3.0. Before 3.0, Spartacus set the `anchorScrolling` and `scrollPositionRestoration` options. In Spartacus 3.0, the `scrollPositionRestoration` has dropped and the `relativeLinkResolution` has been added. See the below table for the actual values and reasoning

| Option | < 3.0 | > 3.0
| --- | --- |  --- 
| `anchorScrolling` | `'enabled'` | `'enabled'`
| `scrollPositionRestoration` | `'enabled'` | (removed)
| `relativeLinkResolution` | n/a | `'corrected'`
| | |

The enabled `scrollPositionRestoration` was causing a bad experience in most cases, as it would scroll the page to the top on each route change. This is unexpected in a single page experience. 

The corrected `relativeLinkResolution` is used to opt-in to [a fix](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37355) that has been added in angular. This will become default from angular 11 onwards. 


The `RouterModule.forRoot()` method can actually only be called _once_ in an angular application. This makes the default options rather opinionated, which is why the default configurations are carefully selected in Spartacus. The options that have been added/removed can be provided in your custom application with the Angular `ROUTER_CONFIGURATION` injection token. For example: 

```typescript
providers: [
    {
        provide: ROUTER_CONFIGURATION,
        useValue: {
        scrollPositionRestoration: 'enabled'
        }
    }
]
```

There's no automation (schematics) planned for this change.
