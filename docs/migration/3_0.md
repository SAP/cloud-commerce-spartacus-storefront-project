# Technical Changes in Spartacus 3.0

## Breaking Changes

### Translations (i18n) changed

- fixed the typo in the key `user.register.managementInMyAccount` (previously ...`managmentInMyAccount`)
- key `checkout.checkoutReview.editShippingMethod` has been removed
- key `checkout.checkoutReview.editPaymentMethod` has been removed

### Default Router options changed

The Angular router can be initialized with so-called `ExtraOptions` in the `forRoot` method fo the `RouterModule`. See https://angular.io/api/router/ExtraOptions for more information on those options.

The default `ExtraOptions` have changed with 3.0. Before 3.0, Spartacus set the `anchorScrolling` and `scrollPositionRestoration` options. In Spartacus 3.0, the `scrollPositionRestoration` has dropped, and the `relativeLinkResolution` and `initialNavigation` has been added. See the below table for the actual values and reasoning

| Option                      | < 3.0       | > 3.0         |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `anchorScrolling`           | `'enabled'` | `'enabled'`   |
| `scrollPositionRestoration` | `'enabled'` | (removed)     |
| `relativeLinkResolution`    | n/a         | `'corrected'` |
| `initialNavigation`         | n/a         | `'enabled'`   |
|                             |             |

The enabled `scrollPositionRestoration` was causing a bad experience in most cases, as it would scroll the page to the top on each route change. This is unexpected in a single page experience.

The corrected `relativeLinkResolution` is used to opt-in to [a fix](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37355) that has been added in angular. This will become default from angular 11 onwards.

The enabled `initialNavigation` provides better experience with server side rendering, starting initial navigation before the root component is created and blocking bootstrap until the initial navigation is complete. More details available in [Angular documentation](https://angular.io/api/router/InitialNavigation).

The `RouterModule.forRoot()` method can actually only be called _once_ in an angular application. This makes the default options rather opinionated, which is why the default configurations are carefully selected in Spartacus. The options that have been added/removed can be provided in your custom application with the Angular `ROUTER_CONFIGURATION` injection token. For example:

```typescript
providers: [
  {
    provide: ROUTER_CONFIGURATION,
    useValue: {
      scrollPositionRestoration: 'enabled',
    },
  },
];
```

There's no automation (schematics) planned for this change.

### Page Layout

With version 2.1 we've started to add the page layout based style class to the root element of the application (`cx-storefront`). This is done in addition to the style class added by the `PageLayoutComponent`. The style class on the `PageLayoutComponent` was considered to be too limited, as it would not affect selectors outside the page template component.

The implementation of the page layout based style class has moved from the `PageLayoutComponent` to the `PageTemplateDirective`. This results in a cleaner `PageLayoutComponent` with a constructor that no longer requires the lower level `renderer2` service and `ElementRef`. The constructor reduces to the following signature:

```ts
constructor(protected pageLayoutService: PageLayoutService) {}
```

We've also made the `PageLayoutService` a _protected_ argument, so that it is extensible.

There's no automation (schematics) planned to migrate constructors automatically.

### Static CMS structure config changes

- `default-header-config` and `default-cms-content-config` have been removed. Use `defaultCmsContentProviders` instead to create CMS content.

### Occ prefix

Default value for `backend.occ.prefix` configuration option was changed from `/rest/v2/` to `/occ/v2/`.

### Storefront config

- New config `SeoConfig` is imported.

### ContentPageMetaResolver

`ContentPageMetaResolver` has a new required constructor dependency `RoutingPageMetaResolver`.

### LoginFormComponent

It's no longer the responsibility of the `LoginFormComponent` to redirect to the anticipated page (it no longer calls the method `AuthRedirectService.redirect`).
Now the redirecting logic is placed inside the core `AuthService` to support more OAuth flows.

`LoginFormComponent` no longer has properties `loginAsGuest`, `sub` and the method `ngOnDestroy`.

### HttpClientModule is not imported in feature libraries

In most cases **HttpClientModule** should only be imported in the root app module, as importing it in lazy-loaded modules can
cause unexpected side effects regarding the visibility of HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, etc. To fix this, we removed all **HttpClientModule** imports from all our
feature libraries and moved them to recipes.

There's no automation (schematics) planned for this change.

### SSR Engine Optimizations

`NgExpressEngineDecorator` now adds SSR Optimization logic on top of the universal engine by default.

`NgExpressEngineDecorator` was moved from `@spartacus/core` to `@spartacus/setup/ssr`. Also `NgExpressEngineDecorator.get()` method now accepts an additional second parameter to fine-tune SSR optimizations. Passing `null` there will turn off optimizations by removing optimization layer completely (bring back default 2.x behavior).

### Store finder functionality has been moved to a new library

Store finder logic from `@spartacus/core` and store finder components from `@spartacus/storefront` were moved to respective entrypoints in `@spartacus/misc/storefinder`.
Store finder translations (`storeFinderTranslations`) and translation chunks (`storeFinderTranslationChunksConfig`) were moved to `@spartacus/misc/storefinder/assets`.
Store finder functionality is now also lazy-loadable out of the box.

### StockNotificationComponent

`StockNotificationComponent` has a new required dependency `UserIdService`, but no more depends on `AuthService`.

### CmsComponentsService

Method `CmsComponentsService.getChildRoutes` changed return type from `Route[]` to `CmsComponentChildRoutesConfig`

### Config cmsComponents

The property `childRoutes` of config `cmsComponents` changed type from `Route[]` to `Route[] | CmsComponentChildRoutesConfig`.

### PageMetaService lazy-loading related changes

- Method `PageMetaService.getMeta` changed its return type from `Observable<PageMeta>` to `Observable<PageMeta | null>` so it can take into account page meta resolvers from lazy loaded features.
- Protected method `PageMetaService.getMetaResolver` changed its return type from `PageMateResolver` to `Observable<PageMetaResolver>` so it can take into account page meta resolvers from lazy loaded features.
- PageMetaService's constructor is now using `UnifiedInjector` instead of injecting `PageMetaResolver` token directly.

### ConverterService lazy-loading related changes

- ConverterService constructor is now using `UnifiedInjector` instead of standard `Injector`

### Payload for constructor of PlaceOrder class from Checkout actions requires an additional property

- Checkout.action constructor payload now needs a `termsChecked` additional property

### PlaceOrderComponent
- `placeOrderSubscription` property was removed - no replacement
- The component has new required constructor dependencies: `CheckoutReplenishmentFormService`, `LaunchDialogService` and `ViewContainerRef`.

### Property renamed in `SearchConfig` interface

| Old Name   | New Name |
| ---------- | -------- |
| `sortCode` | `sort`   |

### Changes in `CheckoutStepsState` interface
- New property: currently required `poNumber: { po: string; costCenter: string; };`
- Change type: property `orderDetails` type has been changed from `Order` to `Order | ReplenishmentOrder`

### Changes in `CheckoutState` interface
- New property: currently required `paymentTypes: PaymentTypesState;`
- New property: currently required `orderType: OrderTypesState;`
  
### OutletRefDirective unregisters template on destroy

The directive's template in unregistered from outlet on directive destroy.

Before v3.0, when an instance of `OutletRefDirective` was destroyed (removed from DOM), its template remained registered for the Outlet, which could cause the same template being rendered multiple times in case of re-creation of the same `[cxOutletRef]` later on. Now it's fixed.

### CartItemComponent lost members

`CartItemComponent` lost members:

- `@Output()` `view` - instead use `[cxModal]` directive to close modal on link click
- `viewItem()` - instead use `[cxModal]` directive to close modal on link click

### CartItemListComponent

There can be more than one cart entry with the same product code. So now they are referenced by the property `entryNumber` instead of the product code in `CartItemListComponent`.

### AddToCartComponent

`AddToCartComponent` lost members:

- `increment` - use new `numberOfEntriesBeforeAdd` instead
- `cartEntry$` - use `activeCartService.getLastEntry(productCode)` instead

### Auth module refactor

- `@spartacus/core` have new dependency on `angular-oauth2-oidc` library. It's used to handle OAuth login/logout flows in spartacus.

#### Store

- `AuthSelectors` were removed. Selectors related to client token were moved under `ClientAuthSelectors`. User token is no longer stored in ngrx store. To get the token use `AuthStorageService.getToken` method.
- `StateWithAuth` was removed. State related to client token was moved to `StateWithClientAuth`. Data related to user token are stored in `AuthStorageService` and `UserIdService`.
- `AuthState` was removed. State related to client token was moved to `ClientAuthState`. Data related to user token are stored in `AuthStorageService` and `UserIdService`.
- `UserTokenState` was removed. Data related to user token are no longer stored in ngrx store. User token is stored in `AuthStorageService` and user id is stored in `UserIdService`.
- `AUTH_FEATURE` was removed. Client token state is under the key from `CLIENT_AUTH_FEATURE` variable.
- `CLIENT_TOKEN_DATA` variable value changed to `[Client auth] Client Token Data`. Previously it was `[Auth] Client Token Data`.
- `AuthActions` now only contains `Login` and `Logout` action class and `LOGIN`, `LOGOUT` variables with action type. Actions related to client token (`LoadClientToken...`) are now available under `ClientAuthActions` export. Constant `LOGOUT_CUSTOMER_SUPPORT_AGENT` is available in `AsmActions` export. Actions related to user token were removed (`LOAD_USER_TOKEN`, `LOAD_USER_TOKEN_FAIL`, `LOAD_USER_TOKEN_SUCCESS`, `REFRESH_USER_TOKEN`, `REFRESH_USER_TOKEN_FAIL`, `REFRESH_USER_TOKEN_SUCCESS`, `REVOKE_USER_TOKEN`, `REVOKE_USER_TOKEN_FAIL`, `REVOKE_USER_TOKEN_SUCCESS`, `LoadUserToken`, `LoadUserTokenFail`, `LoadUserTokenSuccess`, `RefreshUserToken`, `RefreshUserTokenSuccess`, `RefreshUserTokenFail`, `RevokeUserToken`, `RevokeUserTokenSuccess` and `RevokeUserTokenFail`). Instead initialize user token load, refresh or revoke with methods exposed in `AuthService` and `OAuthLibWrapperService`.

#### Models

- `UserToken` interface was replaced with `AuthToken` interface. New interface contains different properties than the previous to match requirements of `angular-oauth2-oidc` library.
- `AuthenticationToken` interface was removed. Use `AuthToken` or `ClientToken` directly.
- `Occ.UserGroupList` interface was removed.
- `Occ.UserSignUp` interface was removed.

#### Guards

- `NotAuthGuard` now returns `Observable<UrlTree>` for homepage for logged in users instead of invoking redirect. Constructor also changed for this guard. `RoutingService` is no longer needed, but `SemanticPathService` and `Router` is now required.
- `AuthGuard` now returns `Observable<UrlTree>` for login page for anonymous users instead of invoking redirect. Constructor also changed for this guard. `RoutingService` is no longer needed, but `SemanticPathService` is now required.

#### Services

- `AuthRedirectService` now requires `AuthRedirectStorageService`. Make sure to provide it. It is an replacement for private variable `redirectUrl`.
- `AuthService` now requires `UserIdService`, `OAuthLibWrapperService`, `AuthStorageService`, `AuthRedirectService` and `RoutingService`.
- `AuthService.authorize` was renamed to `loginWithCredentials`. It returns Promise that resolves after login procedure completes. Instead of dispatching action the method now invokes login method from the OAuth library and sets correct userId, dispatches `Login` action and redirects to previously visited page.
- `AuthService.getOccUserId` was removed from `AuthService`. Use `UserIdService.getUserId` method instead. It is the direct replacement.
- `AuthService.invokeWithUserId` was moved to `UserIdService`. It is available under the same name.
- `AuthService.getUserToken` was removed. To check if user is logged in use `isUserLoggedIn` and to get user id use `UserIdService.getUserId`. If you need access to tokens then use `AuthStorageService.getToken`.
- `AuthService.refreshUserToken` was moved and renamed to `OAuthLibWrapperService.refreshToken`. The behavior changed as well. It not only dispatches action, but performs complete refresh token procedure from OAuth library.
- `AuthService.authorizeWithToken` was removed. Instead you can create object of the shape `AuthToken` and pass to `AuthStorageService.setToken`.
- `AuthService.logout` method changed behavior to redirect to `logout` page. Then the method `AuthService.coreLogout` will be dispatched and perform operations previously done by `logout` method (Logout action dispatch, clearing local state, revoking tokens).
- `AuthService.getClientToken`, `AuthService.refreshClientToken` and `AuthService.isClientTokenLoaded` were moved to `ClientTokenService`.

#### Config

- `AuthConfig` no longer extends `OccConfig`.
- `login` and `revoke` endpoints were removed from `OccConfig`. `login` endpoint is now available under `tokenEndpoint` property in `AuthConfig`. `revoke` endpoint is available under `revokeEndpoint` property in `AuthConfig`.
- `storageSync` configuration for `auth` branch in ngrx store was removed. State of token, userId is now synchronized with `AuthStatePersistenceService`. Override this service if you want to sync more properties to localStorage (eg. `refresh_token`).
- `storageSync` configuration for `anonymous-consents` branch in ngrx store was removed. State is now synchronized with `AnonymousConsentsStatePersistenceService`. Override this service if you want to sync more/less properties to localStorage.

### KymaModule

`KymaModule` were removed with all it's code. We expose the same functionality through configuration of auth.

To fetch OpenId token along with access token in Resource Owner Password Flow you have to use following configuration.

```ts
authentication: {
  client_id: 'client4kyma',
  client_secret: 'secret',
  OAuthLibConfig: {
    responseType: 'id_token',
    scope: 'openid',
    customTokenParameters: ['token_type', 'id_token'],
  }
}
```

Then you can access OpenId token with `OAuthLibWrapperService.getIdToken` method. For more options related to OpenId token look into `angular-oauth2-oidc` library documentation.

### ASM module refactor

- `getCustomerSupportAgentTokenState`, `getCustomerSupportAgentToken` and `getCustomerSupportAgentTokenLoading` were removed from `AsmSelectors`. To get token use `AuthStorageService.getToken` and `AsmAuthStorageService.getTokenTarget` to check if it belongs to CS agent.
- Effects in `AsmModule` now instead of `makeErrorSerializable` use `normalizeHttpError` for error transformation.
- `storageSync` configuration for `asm` branch in ngrx store was removed. State of ASM UI, tokens is now synchronized with `AsmStatePersistenceService`.
- `CSAGENT_TOKEN_DATA` variable was removed.
- `AsmState.csagentToken` was removed. Token is now stored in `AuthStorageService`. Check `AsmAuthStorageService.getTokenTarget` to validate if the token belongs to the CS agent.
- `AsmActions` no longer contains actions related to customer agent token (`LoadCustomerSupportAgentToken`, `LoadCustomerSupportAgentTokenFail`, `LoadCustomerSupportAgentTokenSuccess`). Instead interact directly with `CsAgentAuthService`.
- `CustomerSupportAgentTokenInterceptor` interceptor was removed. Token and error handling for CS agent requests are now handled by `AuthInterceptor` and `AsmAuthHttpHeaderService`.

#### AsmAuthService

Service was renamed to `CsAgentAuthService`. `AsmAuthService` is now responsible for making `AuthService` aware of ASM and adjusts it for CS agent support.

- `AsmAuthService.authorizeCustomerSupportAgent` was moved to `CsAgentAuthService`. It now performs full login flow for CS agent and resolves when it completes.
- `AsmAuthService.startCustomerEmulationSession` was moved to `CsAgentAuthService`. Behavior haven't changed.
- `AsmAuthService.isCustomerEmulationToken` was removed. To check token use `AuthStorageService.getToken` and to check if it belongs to CS agent use `AsmAuthStorageService.getTokenTarget`.
- `AsmAuthService.getCustomerSupportAgentToken` was removed. To check token use `AuthStorageService.getToken` and to check if it belongs to CS agent use `AsmAuthStorageService.getTokenTarget`.
- `AsmAuthService.getCustomerSupportAgentTokenLoading` was moved to `CsAgentAuthService`. Warning! It is not implemented there yet.
- `AsmAuthService.logoutCustomerSupportAgent` was moved to `CsAgentAuthService`. It performs logout procedure for CS agent and resolves when it completes.

### CDC library

- `CdcUserTokenEffects` now uses `normalizeHttpError` for error serialization.
- `CdcUserTokenEffects.loadCdcUserToken$` effect now calls `CdcAuthService.loginWithToken` instead of dispatching `AuthActions.LoadUserTokenSuccess` action.
- `CdcAuthService` no longer extends `AuthService`.
- `CdcAuthService` have new required dependencies. `AuthStorageService`, `UserIdService`, `GlobalMessageService` and `AuthRedirectService` needs to provided.
- `CdcAuthService.authorizeWithCustomCdcFlow` method was renamed to `loginWithCustomCdcFlow`.
- `CdcAuthService.logout` method was removed. Now CDC hooks into logout process, by providing `CdcLogoutGuard` as `LogoutGuard`.
- `CdcJsService` now requires `AuthService` as `CdcAuthService` no longer extends it. `AuthService` should be passed after `CdcAuthService`. `CdcAuthService` is available in service under `cdcAuth` and `AuthService` is available under `auth` property. Additionally `GlobalMessageService` and `AuthRedirectService` are not longer required. We don't provide automatic migration for that constructor change!

  ) {}
```

Now it is:

```ts
  constructor(
    @Inject(Config) protected config: any,

### OccCmsComponentAdapter

The OCC CMS component API in SAP Commerce Cloud before version 1905 was using a POST method. This has changed in 1905 (using GET going forward). Spartacus has supported both version from version 1.0 by using a `legacy` flag to distinguish this backend API behavior. With release 3.0 we maintain the support for the pre 1905 CMS component API, but the implementation has moved to a separate adapter (`LegacyOccCmsComponentAdapter`). With that change, we're also dropping the `legacy` flag in the OCC configuration.
