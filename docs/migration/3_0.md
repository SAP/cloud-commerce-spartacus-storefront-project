# Technical Changes in Spartacus 3.0

## Breaking Changes

### Default Router options changed
The Angular router can be initialized with so-called `ExtraOptions` in the `forRoot` method fo the `RouterModule`. See https://angular.io/api/router/ExtraOptions for more information on those options. 

The default `ExtraOptions` have changed with 3.0. Before 3.0, Spartacus set the `anchorScrolling` and `scrollPositionRestoration` options. In Spartacus 3.0, the `scrollPositionRestoration` has dropped, and the `relativeLinkResolution` and `initialNavigation` has been added. See the below table for the actual values and reasoning

| Option | < 3.0 | > 3.0
| --- | --- |  --- 
| `anchorScrolling` | `'enabled'` | `'enabled'`
| `scrollPositionRestoration` | `'enabled'` | (removed)
| `relativeLinkResolution` | n/a | `'corrected'`
| `initialNavigation` | n/a | `'enabled'`
| | |

The enabled `scrollPositionRestoration` was causing a bad experience in most cases, as it would scroll the page to the top on each route change. This is unexpected in a single page experience. 

The corrected `relativeLinkResolution` is used to opt-in to [a fix](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37355) that has been added in angular. This will become default from angular 11 onwards. 

The enabled `initialNavigation` provides better experience with server side rendering, starting initial navigation before the root component is created and blocking bootstrap until the initial navigation is complete. More details available in  [Angular documentation](https://angular.io/api/router/InitialNavigation).

The `RouterModule.forRoot()` method can actually only be called _once_ in an angular application. This makes the default options rather opinionated, which is why the default configurations are carefully selected in Spartacus. The options that have been added/removed can be provided in your custom application with the Angular `ROUTER_CONFIGURATION` injection token. For example: 

```typescript
providers: [
    {
        provide: ROUTER_CONFIGURATION,
        useValue: {
        scrollPositionRestoration: 'enabled'
        }
    }
]
```

There's no automation (schematics) planned for this change. 

### Page Layout
With version 2.1 we've started to add the page layout based style class to the root element of the application (`cx-storefront`). This is done in addition to the style class added by the `PageLayoutComponent`. The style class on the `PageLayoutComponent` was considered to be too limited, as it would not affect selectors outside the page template component. 

The implementation of the page layout based style class has moved from the `PageLayoutComponent` to the `PageTemplateDirective`. This results in a cleaner `PageLayoutComponent` with a constructor that no longer requires the lower level `renderer2` service and `ElementRef`. The constructor reduces to the following signature: 
```ts
constructor(protected pageLayoutService: PageLayoutService) {}
```

We've also made the `PageLayoutService` a _protected_ argument, so that it is extensible. 

There's no automation (schematics) planned to migrate constructors automatically. 

### HttpClientModule is not imported in feature libraries
 
In most cases **HttpClientModule** should only be imported in the root app module, as importing it in lazy-loaded modules can
cause unexpected side effects regarding the visibility of HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, etc. To fix this, we removed all **HttpClientModule** imports from all our
feature libraries and moved them to recipes. 

There's no automation (schematics) planned for this change. 
    
### PageMetaService lazy-loading related changes

- Protected method `PageMetaService.getMetaResolver` changed its return type from `PageMateResolver` to `Observable<PageMetaResolver>` so it can take into account page meta resolvers from lazy loaded features. 
- PageMetaService's constructor is now using `UnifiedInjector` instead of injecting `PageMetaResolver` token directly.  

### ConverterService lazy-loading related changes

- ConverterService constructor is now using `UnifiedInjector` instead of standard `Injector` 

### CartItemListComponent
There can be more than one cart entry with the same product code. So now they are referenced by the property `entryNumber` instead of the product code in `CartItemListComponent`.

### AddedToCartDialogComponent lost members
`AddedToCartDialogComponent` lost members: 
- `increment` - use new `numberOfEntriesBeforeAdd` instead
- `cartEntry$` - use `activeCartService.getLastEntry(productCode)` instead

### Auth module refactor

- `@spartacus/core` have new dependency on `angular-oauth2-oidc` library. It's used to handle OAuth login/logout flows in spartacus.

#### Store

- `AuthSelectors` were removed. Selectors related to client token were moved under `ClientAuthSelectors`. User token is no longer stored in ngrx store. To get the token use `AuthStorageService.getToken` method.
- `StateWithAuth` was removed. State related to client token was moved to `StateWithClientAuth`. Data related to user token are stored in `AuthStorageService` and `UserIdService`.
- `AuthState` was removed. State related to client token was moved to `ClientAuthState`. Data related to user token are stored in `AuthStorageService` and `UserIdService`.
- `UserTokenState` was removed. Data related to user token are no longer stored in ngrx store. User token is stored in `AuthStorageService` and user id is stored in `UserIdService`.
- `AUTH_FEATURE` was removed. Client token state is under the key from `CLIENT_AUTH_FEATURE` variable.
- `CLIENT_TOKEN_DATA` variable value changed to `[Client auth] Client Token Data`. Previously it was `[Auth] Client Token Data`.
- `AuthActions` now only contains `Login` and `Logout` action class and `LOGIN`, `LOGOUT` variables with action type. Actions related to client token (`LoadClientToken...`) are now available under `ClientAuthActions` export. Constant `LOGOUT_CUSTOMER_SUPPORT_AGENT` is available in `AsmActions` export. Actions related to user token were removed. Instead initialize user token load, refresh or revoke with methods exposed in `AuthService` and `OAuthLibWrapperService`.

#### Models

- `UserToken` interface was replaced with `AuthToken` interface. New interface contains different properties than the previous to match requirements of `angular-oauth2-oidc` library.

#### Guards 

- `NotAuthGuard` now returns `Observable<UrlTree>` for homepage for logged in users instead of invoking redirect. Constructor also changed for this guard. `RoutingService` is no longer needed, but `SemanticPathService` and `Router` is now required.
- `AuthGuard` now returns `Observable<UrlTree>` for login page for anonymous users instead of invoking redirect. Constructor also changed for this guard. `RoutingService` is no longer needed, but `SemanticPathService` is now required.

#### Services

- `AuthRedirectService` now requires `AuthRedirectStorageService`. Make sure to provide it. It is an replacement for private variable `redirectUrl`.
- `AuthService` now requires `UserIdService`, `OAuthLibWrapperService`, `AuthStorageService`, `AuthRedirectService` and `RoutingService`.
- `AuthService.authorize` was renamed to `loginWithCredentials`. It returns Promise that resolves after login procedure completes. Instead of dispatching action the method now invokes login method from the OAuth library and sets correct userId, dispatches `Login` action and redirects to previously visited page.
- `AuthService.getOccUserId` was removed from `AuthService`. Use `UserIdService.getUserId` method instead. It is the direct replacement.
- `AuthService.invokeWithUserId` was moved to `UserIdService`. It is available under the same name.
- `AuthService.getUserToken` was removed. To check if user is logged in use `isUserLoggedIn` and to get user id use `UserIdService.getUserId`. If you need access to tokens then use `AuthStorageService.getToken`.
- `AuthService.refreshUserToken` was moved and renamed to `OAuthLibWrapperService.refreshToken`. The behavior changed as well. It not only dispatches action, but performs complete refresh token procedure from OAuth library.
- `AuthService.authorizeWithToken` was removed. Instead you can create object of the shape 'AuthToken' and pass to 'AuthStorageService.setToken'.
- `AuthService.logout` method changed behavior to redirect to `logout` page. Then the method `AuthService.coreLogout` will be dispatched and perform operations previously done by `logout` method (Logout action dispatch, clearing local state, revoking tokens).
- `AuthService.getClientToken`, `AuthService.refreshClientToken` and `AuthService.isClientTokenLoaded` were moved to `ClientTokenService`.

#### Config

- `AuthConfig` no longer extends `OccConfig`.
- `login` and `revoke` endpoints were removed from `OccConfig`. `login` endpoint is now available under `tokenEndpoint` property in `AuthConfig`. `revoke` endpoint is available under `revokeEndpoint` property in `AuthConfig`.
- `storageSync` configuration for `auth` branch in ngrx store was removed. State of token, userId is now synchronized with `AuthStatePersistenceService`. Override this service if you want to sync more properties to localStorage (eg. `refresh_token`).
