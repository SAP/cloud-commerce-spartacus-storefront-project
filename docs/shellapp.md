# Angular Storefront App

---

## Minimum Requirements

```
Node.js >= 8.9.0
yarn >= 1.6.0
Read access to Artifactory (https://repository.hybris.com)
```

## Dependencies Configuration

This is a one time setup. We pull all of our dependencies from our internal npm registry (artifactory). In order for you to be able to do this, you need to do the following:

1.  Login to [artifactory](https://repository.hybris.com/webapp/#/login)
2.  Once you have login, there should be an `npm repository` link on the homepage, in the "Set Me Up" section. Click on it and a popup window with instructions will appear.
3.  Enter your password in the upper right. This will populate the commands with your encrypted password. This way you can copy and paste the commands directly in the terminal.
4.  Out of all the commands in the popup, you will only need to run the first one on your machine. It looks like:

```
$ curl -u[firstname.lastname@sap.com]:[encryptedpassword] https://repository.hybris.com/api/npm/auth
```

As instructed next, paste the result in your ~/.npmrc file (create the file if it doesn't exist)

The last step is to add this line to ~/.npmrc:

```
registry=https://repository.hybris.com/api/npm/npm-repository/
```

That's it. For a quick way to confirm your new config, you can run:

```
$ yarn config list
```

You should see your new ~/.npmrc configurations at the end of the list, in the `info npm config` section.

## Installation Steps

Install dependencies:

```
$ yarn install
```

Start the angular app.

```
$ yarn start
```

Then point your browser to http://localhost:4200/

Google Chrome is recommended.
