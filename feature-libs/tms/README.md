# Spartacus TMS Library

Spartacus' Tag Management System library offers a default support for various TMS implementations (e.g. Adobe Launch, GTM, etc.).

It can be added to the existing Spartacus application by running `ng add @spartacus/tms`. For more information about Spartacus schematics, visit the [official Spartacus schematics documentation page](https://sap.github.io/spartacus-docs/schematics/).
