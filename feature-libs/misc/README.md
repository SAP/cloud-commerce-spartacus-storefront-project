# Spartacus Miscellaneous Features Library

Spartacus miscellaneous features can be added by running `ng add @spartacus/misc` which will present an interactive menu, from which you can select which features you would like to setup.

`@spartacus/misc/storefinder` is a package that you can include in your application, which allows you to use storefinder features.
